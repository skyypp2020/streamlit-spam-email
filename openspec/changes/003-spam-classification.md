# Phase3: Production Readiness

## Summary
Prepare the spam classification system for production deployment by implementing API endpoints, optimizing performance, and ensuring proper documentation and testing.

## Context
- Model optimization completed in Phase 2
- Need production-ready deployment
- Require API interface
- Focus on reliability and maintainability

## Goals
- Create REST API for model serving
- Optimize for production performance
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Prepare deployment documentation

## Technical Design

### API Development
1. REST API endpoints:
   - Prediction endpoint
   - Batch processing
   - Model info endpoint
   - Health checks

2. API features:
   - Request validation
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Response caching

### Production Optimization
1. Model serving:
   - Model serialization
   - Lazy loading
   - Batch processing
   - Caching strategy

2. Performance:
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Memory optimization
   - CPU/GPU utilization

### Documentation
1. API documentation:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specs
   - Usage examples
   - Rate limits
   - Error codes

2. Deployment guide:
   - System requirements
   - Installation steps
   - Configuration
   - Monitoring setup

## Testing Strategy
- End-to-end testing
- Load testing
- Security testing
- Integration testing
- API testing

## Timeline
1. API Development (4 days)
2. Performance Optimization (3 days)
3. Documentation (2 days)
4. Testing & Validation (3 days)

## Success Metrics
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Support for 100 req/sec
- Zero security vulnerabilities

## Dependencies
- Completed Phase 2
- Optimized model
- Testing infrastructure
- Performance benchmarks
