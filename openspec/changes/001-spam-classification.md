# Phase1: Data Processing and Initial Model Development

## Summary
Implement the foundational components of a machine learning-based spam email classification system, focusing on data processing pipeline and initial model development.

## Context
- Current system lacks automated spam detection
- Need to process and classify emails efficiently
- Have access to labeled dataset (sms_spam_no_header.csv)
- This is Phase 1 of the spam classification project

## Project Phases Overview
1. Phase 1 (Current): Data Processing and Initial Model Development
   - Setup project structure
   - Implement data preprocessing
   - Create basic model pipeline
   - Initial model training and evaluation

2. Phase 2 (Planned): Model Optimization and Feature Engineering
   - Advanced feature engineering
   - Model tuning and optimization
   - Performance improvements
   - Cross-validation and metrics refinement

3. Phase 3 (Planned): Production Readiness
   - API development
   - Model serialization
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation and testing
   - Deployment preparation

## Goals
- Create a robust spam classification model
- Achieve >95% classification accuracy
- Minimize false positives (<1%)
- Process emails in real-time (<100ms)

## Technical Design

### Data Processing
1. Create data preprocessing pipeline:
   - Text cleaning
   - Tokenization
   - Feature extraction
   - Vectorization

2. Implement feature engineering:
   - TF-IDF transformation
   - Text statistics
   - Meta-feature extraction
   - Email header analysis

### Model Development
1. Train multiple models:
   - Naive Bayes
   - SVM
   - Random Forest
   - Compare performance

2. Model evaluation:
   - Cross-validation
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC curves
   - Performance metrics

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up project structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── preprocessing.py
   │   └── features.py
   ├── models/
   │   ├── base.py
   │   └── classifier.py
   ├── utils/
   │   └── metrics.py
   └── config.py
   ```

2. Create core components:
   - DataPreprocessor class
   - FeatureExtractor class
   - SpamClassifier class
   - Evaluation utilities

3. Implement pipeline stages:
   - Data loading
   - Preprocessing
   - Feature extraction
   - Model training
   - Evaluation
   - Serialization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for pipeline
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-validation results
- Error analysis

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Class imbalance
  Mitigation: Use stratified sampling, SMOTE

- Risk: Overfitting
  Mitigation: Cross-validation, regularization

- Risk: Performance issues
  Mitigation: Optimize feature extraction

## Timeline
1. Setup & Data Processing (2 days)
2. Feature Engineering (3 days)
3. Model Development (4 days)
4. Testing & Optimization (3 days)
5. Documentation (1 day)

## Success Metrics
